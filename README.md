## üìã Project Overview

The aim of this project is to predict student exam scores based on various demographic and academic features. The project is structured into several key components:

- **Data Ingestion:** Collection and preparation of raw data for processing.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Feature scaling, categorical variable encoding, and handling of missing values to ensure data readiness.
- **Model Training:** Training and evaluation of multiple regression models to find the best predictor.
- **Deployment:** Deployment of the trained model via a Flask API, coupled with an HTML frontend for interactive predictions.

## üöÄ Features

- **Multiple Regression Models:** Comparison of various models including Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, XGBoost, and CatBoost.
- **Model Optimization:** Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to achieve optimal model performance, with an R¬≤ score of 88.06%.
- **Real-Time Prediction:** Deployed on Render for live predictions through a user-friendly web interface.
- **Scalable API:** Flask-based API for model serving, ensuring quick and reliable predictions.
